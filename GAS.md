# Gas costs and subsidization

Below is the gas usage of common delegator actions (small differences may apply due to difference in Ethereum versions).

|                                                 | Gas    | Estimated cost (assuming: 1 gas = 50 gwei, 1 ether = 500$) |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| New delegator delegates and stakes (Tetra flow) | 292837 | 7.32$                                                      |
| Delegator increases stake                       | 214802 | 5.37$                                                      |
| Delegator unstakes partially                    | 188899 | 4.72$                                                      |
| Delegator fully unstakes                        | 186712 | 4.66$                                                      |
| Delegator claims staking rewards (first time)   | 342404 | 8.56$                                                      |
| Delegator claims staking rewards (second time)  | 272122 | 6.80$                                                      |

Cost formula: `gas * <gas price in gwei> * <ether price in usd> / 1000000000`.

## Subsudizing gas costs

In the case where the rising gas prices becomes an issue, a governance decision can me made to subsudize staking and unstaking actions.
The suggested flow is as follows:

1. Disconnect the staking contract from the PoS ecosystem. Once this is done, staking actions will not immediatly be reflected on the committe, rewards, etc.
  This operation can be done by the migrationManager, by calling the StakingContractHandler contract: `StakingContractHandler.setNotifyDelegations(false)`.
  
2. From this point, the StakingContractHandler contract will emit a `StakeChangeNotificationSkipped` event whenever a staking action takes place, containing the address of the staker. These events should be tracked by the subsudizer.

3. The subsudizer (which does not require any permissions) should then call the DelegationsContract `refreshStake` with each staker address from the list of stakers aquired in 2. This will update the PoS echosystem with the stake change.

4. To reconnect the staking contract and disable subsudizing, the migrationManager should call `StakingContractHandler.setNotifyDelegations(false)`.
